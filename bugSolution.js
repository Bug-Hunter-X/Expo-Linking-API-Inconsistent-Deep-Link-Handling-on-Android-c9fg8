This solution focuses on using a combination of `Linking.getInitialURLAsync()` and `Linking.addEventListener` to ensure that deep links are handled, even if the app was launched from the deep link or is in the background.  This approach enhances the reliability across various Android versions. 

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [initialUrl, setInitialUrl] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleDeepLink = async (event) => {
      // Handle deep link event.  If the app was launched via a deep link,
      // the event will be null
      const url = event?.url || initialUrl;
      if (url) {
        // Process the deep link
        console.log('Deep link received:', url);
      }
    };
    Linking.addEventListener('url', handleDeepLink);

    // Check if the app was launched via a deep link.  
    Linking.getInitialURLAsync().then(setInitialUrl);

    return () => Linking.removeEventListener('url', handleDeepLink);
  }, []);

  // ... rest of the app
}

```
